# Redux-app

  The purpose of this React.js application is to show the use of redux library for better state management. 
  The application retrieves data from a specific GitHub repository and allows their visualization and manipulation.

## Features

* Get last 30 commits from default branch for a specified repository
* List all the developers that contributed and filter commits by setting developer as active or inactive
* Display developers contribution (%) by using Pie Chart (Donut)
* Display all the fetched commits by using unidirected Graph
* Manipulate with selected commit by changing its author and parent nodes
* Deleting selected commit

## Prerequisites

  Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
  
## Install & Run

  Use the node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install and run Redux-app.

  ```bash
  npm install

  npm start
  ```

## Structure
  
  Application contains five containers(smart components) which are using and communicating across the same store. 
  Also, there are two stateless components(dumb components) whose only purpose is to render reusable UI.
  Store is <strong>normalized</strong> and <strong>modularized</strong>.
